    "The method goes through all the elements of an array one by one until the searched value is found.",
    "Traditionally, a for loop is used, which means that at each return, in addition to seeing if the current value matches the one sought,",
    "two other operations must be carried out:",
    "- knowing if i is within the limits of the array",
    "- and assigning the appropriate value to i to keep iterating.",
    "With the idea of reducing these two operations, Cormen proposes the current implementation.",
    "1ยบ Replace the last element of the array with the value sought, and keep the value that the last element had.",
    "2ยบ Go through the array whenever we do not find the value sought (here we save the i and the verification of its limits),",
    "3ยบ Reassign the value it had to the last element of the array.",
    "4th Confirm if it was found: If i is less than the length of the array, return i If the last value is equal to the one sought, return i",
    "That brand is called sentinel.",
    "This function is the optimization recommended by Thomas H. Cormen."
